                <h1 class="title">Gameplay</h1>
                <p><span style="color: white; font-weight: bold;">Genshin Impact</span> is an open-world, action role-playing game that allows the player to control one of four interchangeable characters in a party. Switching between 
                    characters can be done quickly during combat, allowing the player to use several different combinations of skills and attacks. Characters may have their abilities 
                    enhanced in various ways, mainly through directly leveling them up and improving the artifacts and weapons that a character can equip. In addition to exploration, 
                    the player can attempt various challenges for rewards. Scattered across Teyvat are bosses and challenges that reward highly valuable resources, but claiming them uses 
                    up a currency called Original Resin, which slowly regenerates over time. Completing these challenges grants the player progress towards increasing their Adventure 
                    Rank, which in turn unlocks new quests, challenges, and raises the World Level. The World Level is a measure of how strong the enemies within the world are and the 
                    rarity of rewards that defeating them gives.</p>
                <p>The player can control their character and perform actions such as running, climbing, swimming, and gliding, all limited by stamina. Some characters possess 
                    abilities that can alter the environment, such as freezing water to create an ice path that can aid the player in traversing terrain. Many teleportation points exist 
                    throughout the world that players can warp to as a form of fast travel; among these are landmarks known as Statues of The Seven that can heal and revive characters, and 
                    provide benefits such as increasing player stamina. Items such as food and ore may be procured from the open world, while enemies and treasure chests drop other types 
                    of resources that may be used in enhancing a character's strength. Players can obtain food from hunting animals, gathering fruit and vegetables, or purchasing them from 
                    in-game shops. Furthermore, there are special battle instances called "Domains" that reward materials which increase character and weapon strength. Meals cooked from 
                    ingredients gathered in the overworld may also provide desirable effects, such as regenerating characters' health or boosting various stats. Players can also procure 
                    ore that can be refined and then used to create weapons or enhance their strength.</p>

            </div>

            <p>A multiplayer mode is available in the form of co-op. Up to four players can play together in the overworld and join Domains. Player matching can either be done by requesting 
                to connect with another player, or through an automatic search. The game features cross-platform play, so players on any platform can play with each other.</p>
            <p>By completing certain quests or by participating in select limited-time events, the player can unlock additional playable characters. Most characters, however, are obtained 
                through the character banners of the game's gacha system, called "Wishes". Several premium in-game currencies, obtainable through in-app purchases or as gameplay 
                rewards, are required to pull on the game's banners. A pity system guarantees that the player will receive rare items after a set number of pulls.</p>

                <p>Playable characters have control over one of seven natural elements: <span style="color: lightgreen; font-weight: bold;">Anemo (air)</span>, <span style="color: brown; font-weight: bold;">Geo (earth)</span>, 
                    <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">Pyro (fire)</span>, <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold;">Hydro (water)</span>, <span style="color: lightblue; font-weight: bold;">Cryo (ice)</span>, 
                    <span style="color: purple; font-weight: bold;">Electro (electricity)</span>, and <span style="color: green; font-weight: bold;">Dendro (plants)</span>. When these elements react with one another, 
                    they produce various effects. For instance, if a Hydro attack hits a target, the enemy will be inflicted with the "Wet" status effect, and if they are hit with a subsequent 
                    Cryo attack, these two status effects combine to freeze the opponent, temporarily preventing them from 
                    performing any actions.</p>
                <p>Each character also has two unique combat abilities: an <span style="color: yellow; font-weight: bold;">"Elemental Skill"</span> and an <span style="color: yellow; font-weight: bold">"Elemental Burst"</span>. 
                    Elemental Skills are attacks with a set cooldown that can be used at any time, while Elemental Bursts are ultimate attacks with an energy cost. These require the player to amass sufficient elemental energy in 
                    order to use them. Manipulating the game's elements through the Skills and Bursts of a given party's four characters to produce various reactions is a core feature of its gameplay. 
                    Certain elemental abilities are also required to solve puzzles within the overworld.</p>

                <h4>Mondstadt</h4>
                <p>The Traveler and Paimon arrive in Mondstadt city to find it being terrorized by a dragon called Stormterror. They work together with the Knights of Favonius to 
                    resolve the problem. They meet a carefree bard named Venti, and learn that Stormterror – whose real name is Dvalin – is Venti's friend and has been corrupted by 
                    the Abyss Order. Venti reveals himself to be Barbatos, the Anemo Archon, and purifies Dvalin with The Traveler. After solving the crisis, Venti and The Traveler 
                    are ambushed by La Signora, the Eighth Fatui Harbinger, who steals Venti's Gnosis.</p>

                <h4>Liyue</h4>
                <p>The Traveler and Paimon go to Liyue Harbor to attend a ritual for Rex Lapis, only for him to descend lifelessly from the sky. They are assisted by the mortician Zhongli 
                    and the Eleventh Fatui Harbinger, Tartaglia, in performing a rite of farewell for the Archon, but Tartaglia betrays them and attempts to steal Rex Lapis's Gnosis. After 
                    this plot is foiled by The Traveler, Tartaglia summons the ancient serpent god Osial to attack Liyue, but the adepti and humans successfully defend the city. Later, The 
                    Traveler learns that Zhongli is actually Rex Lapis and that the Archon has retired, exchanging his Gnosis with La Signora. Soon thereafter, The Traveler and Paimon meet 
                    Dainsleif, a mysterious stranger who assists them in investigating the Abyss Order's plot to overthrow Celestia. The Traveler's lost twin is revealed as the leader of the 
                    Abyss Order, but they refuse to reunite. Dainsleif chases after the twin, while The Traveler continues their mission.</p>

                <h4>Inazuma</h4>
                <p>The Traveler and Paimon arrive in the isolationist nation of Inazuma and learn that its Archon, the Raiden Shogun, has been confiscating Inazumans' Visions. After barely 
                    escaping the Shogun's forces, The Traveler and Paimon join a band of separatists on Inazuma's Watatsumi Island before meeting Scaramouche, the Sixth Fatui Harbinger. 
                    Though he knocks The Traveler and Paimon unconscious, Yae Miko – the Shogun's familiar – grants him Raiden's Gnosis in exchange for their lives. With Miko's help, The 
                    Traveler battles and defeats the Shogun, and convinces her to repeal her restrictive policies. After returning to Liyue, the Traveler reunites with Dainsleif in The Chasm. 
                    The Traveler experiences a vision of their twin in Khaenri'ah, feeling torn between joining them and defeating the Abyss Order. Dainsleif tells The Traveler that they must 
                    choose between Teyvat or their twin before departing once more.</p>

                    The Traveler eventually meets her human vessel, Nahida, within a dream, and discovers that the Akademiya's sages have partnered with Dottore, the Second Fatui Harbinger, 
                    to overthrow Kusanali and install Scaramouche as an artificial god. With the help of key individuals in Sumeru, The Traveler thwarts the sages' plot. The Traveler then 
                    meets with Kusanali, who provides valuable information about their twin and suggests that they visit Focalors, the Archon of Fontaine. Afterward, The Traveler runs into 
                    Dainsleif before having a vision of their sibling's encounter with a Khaenri'ahn named Chlothar Alberich, the founder of the Abyss Order, as well as with a mysterious "Sinner".</p>

                <h4>Masquerade of the Guilty</h4>
                <h4>Fontaine</h4>
                <p>The Traveler and Paimon journey to Fontaine to meet with Focalors, the Hydro Archon. They learn of the circulating prophecy that Fontaine would be flooded, leaving only 
                    the Hydro Archon weeping on her throne. Upon their arrival, they are greeted by the Archon's human vessel, Lady Furina. They attend a magic show, but the show is interrupted 
                    when the two performing magicians are framed for murder; Traveler must then be their defense against the prosecution, Furina. They also uncover the truth behind a serial 
                    kidnapping case - the kidnapper had used a substance known as Primordial Seawater to dissolve those from Fontaine into water. Tartaglia, who is in Fontaine, gets accused 
                    of the crime and is arrested and sent to prison. The Traveller and Paimon are sent to the Fortress of Meropide, an underwater place for convicts, to investigate Tartaglia's 
                    disappearance after his arrest. They discover that a flood of Primordial Seawater is threatening to burst out. The flood of Primordial Seawater was then prevented by Neuvillette. 
                    Furina's status as an Archon was also questioned, as the Fatui Harbinger Arlecchino reveals to the Traveler that she attacked Furina, intending to steal the Gnosis, but found 
                    nothing. Later, Neuvillette is revealed to be the current Dragon Sovereign of Water, successor to one of the original dragon rulers of Teyvat before the rise of the Archons 
                    and the heavens, and that the power of the Archons is derived from the power of the Dragons.
                <p>In the final act, Neuvillette and the Traveler find a group of ancient stone slates relating to the prophecy, and realize Furina has a secret. They trick Furina into a trial 
                    case, where now the Traveler stands as prosecution, and proves Furina to be not a god, but a cursed human who has lived for 500 years, acting as a god. This sets into motion 
                    the final stage of the prophecy, and Neuvillette discovers that Egeria, the original Hydro Archon, had created humans using the power of Primordial Seawater (which is why people 
                    from Fontaine could be dissolved with the same seawater) and was punished by the heavens with the prophecy. Her successor, Focalors, had split her divinity from her human body, 
                    Furina (who would pretend to be a god), while Focalors would reverse the prophecy and ultimately sacrifice herself, thus restoring power to Neuvillette. The people of Fontaine 
                    are then turned into true humans by Neuvillette and saved from the prophecy, and Furina steps down from her role as an Archon to live as an ordinary human.</p>
